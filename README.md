Read this very carefully because almost everyone provides the wrong answer. 

By taking this challenge, you swear to not look at any Pull Requests until after you have submitted your own.

Write a program in PHP that finds the 444th prime number, which after being converted to hexadecimal, contains the word "beef" in it. 

You must provide both the integer and its hex code, and it must have the word "beef" in it. 

'c2f" is not the correct answer. A correct solution will take at least 15 minutes to find the answer.
